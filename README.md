# Obtaining quality metrics for object detectors
## General features
This script aims to get the Precision, Recall, AP, Score metric values for each class, as well as the mAP metric. Also Precision(Recall), F1(Score), ROC curves can be plotted for each class. The metric values can be saved in a .csv file. You can save the plotted curves as a .jpg image. You can also send data on the received metrics values to the terminal.
